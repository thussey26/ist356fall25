    "\n",
    "Artifical Intelligence has become more accessible thanks to REST API's. It is not possible to run most of these models on your local machine due to the computational power required. Companies like Open AI, Anthropic, and Perplexity have made it possible to access their models through Web API's. This has opened up a new world of possibilities for developers to build applications that can understand and generate human-like text, create art / music, and solve puzzles.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course will use Open AI's API to demonstrate some of these capabilities. \n",

    "- Text generation is the process of generating text using a model that has been trained on a large corpus of text. We provide the model a **text prompt** consisting of a question, instructions, examples, or both. The model then generates a response based on the prompt."

      "3. **It empowers you**: By taking control of your own transformation, you're gaining confidence, self-awareness, and personal power.\n",
      "4. **It shows no weakness**: Your response is perceived as strong and rational, rather than weak or vengeful.\n",

      "Computers use binary because it's the most efficient way to represent and process information using electronic devices. Here are some reasons why:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Electronic switches**: In the early days of computing, electronic devices were used to perform calculations and operations. These devices relied on electrical circuits that could be switched ON or OFF using voltage levels (0V or 5V). Binary code took advantage of this property by representing information as a series of ON/OFF states.\n",
      "2. **Simpllicity**: Binary is the simplest possible representation of information, with only two distinct values: 0 and 1. This simplicity makes it easier to design and build electronic circuits that can process binary data quickly and accurately.\n",
      "3. **Speed**: Binary code allows for fast processing because electronic devices can quickly switch between ON and OFF states. This speed is crucial in computers, where quick execution of instructions is necessary for efficient operation.\n",
      "4. **Error detection and correction**: The use of binary code enables built-in error detection and correction mechanisms. For example, if a bit (0 or 1) is accidentally flipped during transmission, the receiving device can detect the error by comparing the received data to the expected value. This ensures that data corruption is minimized.\n",
      "5. **Scalability**: As computers became more complex and large-scale integrated circuits (LSI) were developed, binary code proved scalable for representing increasingly complex information. It allowed for the creation of larger and faster computers with minimal changes to the underlying architecture.\n",
      "\n",
      "While other number systems, like decimal or hexadecimal, could be used, binary has become the standard due to its simplicity, speed, and scalability. Today, computers continue to rely on binary to process and store vast amounts of data efficiently.\n"

      "HIPPIE : Far out, man! Think of your car as a groovy dance floor. When you're moving and grooving, sometimes it can be tough to keep your moves smooth and effortless, especially when trying to spin and turn. That’s where power steering comes in, like a trusty friend giving you a gentle push to help you keep your rhythm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine you're at a wild dance party, and you want to make a sharp turn. Without that friend, you might struggle, feeling all the weight of the world (or the car) on your shoulders. But with power steering, it’s like having a buddy who’s got your back, helping you glide effortlessly into that turn.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s how it works, man: when you turn the steering wheel, it sends a message to a pump, which is like a DJ spinning the tunes to keep the vibe alive. This pump uses hydraulic fluid—think of it as the magic potion that makes everything flow smoothly. It works to amplify your effort, so even if you’re just lightly nudging the wheel, the car responds with a smooth, slick turn, just like a well-choreographed dance move. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, power steering is all about making your ride easier and more enjoyable, letting you groove without the heavy lifting. Peace and love, my friend! 🌼✌️\n",

      "Power steering be a system that makes it easier for a landlubber to turn the wheel of their ship—or car, as ye landfolk call it. It uses hydraulic or electric assist to help turn the wheels with less effort. \n",
      "\n",
      "In hydraulic systems, when ye turn the steering wheel, it opens a valve that allows pressurized fluid to flow into a cylinder, pushing a piston that helps turn the wheels. In electric systems, sensors detect the steering input and an electric motor provides the necessary assist.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, while it ain’t quite the thrill of raising the Jolly Roger or plundering gold, it surely helps ye navigate through the treacherous waters of city streets without breaking a sweat! Now, back to tales of treasure and the high seas! Arrr! 🏴‍☠️\n",
      "ROBOT : Power steering uses hydraulic or electric actuators to assist the driver in turning the steering wheel. Hydraulic systems use fluid pressure, while electric systems use an electric motor. Beep boop.\n"
